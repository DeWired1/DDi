[ DEVIOUS INTENT ]
Forbidden knowledge is usually forbidden for a reason...but that wouldn't stop a brave, and might I add, beautiful, adventurer like yourself, would it? What is it that you seek, then? Daedra summoning rituals, maybe? Dark magic to siphon the very souls from your enemies? Lost Dwemer artifacts, one of those gargantuan machines of theirs, perhaps? The most secret of histories from Tamriel's past? Sheogorath's favorite sweet roll recipe?

No? None of that, you say? You want something even more...devious than all of that, do you? Aren't we the adventurous sort? Your sheer bravery must match your most lovely countenance, then. Well, my girl, allow me to share with you a rumor that I heard about a week ago down in Riften at the tavern. There was a young mage apprentice there, looking for some moldy old tome or another, as mages are so fond of doing, who happened to enjoy her wine a bit too much. Thank you for the drink by the way; you're looking better by the minute, my dear.

She was quite the trollop as I was told, going from one patron to the next, man, woman, even lizard if you can believe that. Well, she wasn't shy with her body, nor was she shy with her secrets. She let slip a juicy bit of information about her college back in Winterhold, about the library there. See, there's a bookshelf there that nobody is allowed to open, a shelf filled with the most devious of knowledge one could imagine. The old Orc librarian nearly threw her out of the school for trying to peek inside, she said! Why, what devious knowledge could be found inside there, I wonder? It must be something if they threatened expulsion for just trying to look inside.

Oh, no my dear, no more drink for me, I'm afraid. I must be off, lots of old, filthy dwemer ruins to delve and all that. Hmm? No, no, I'm not going alone, of course not, that would just be silly. My traveling partner is tied up around here somewhere. You would make quite the lovely specimen, though, er, companion, yes, companion! Why don't you be a good girl and head on up to the College in Winterhold, then, and take a look at that forbidden bookshelf for yourself, hmm? I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for there...and just forget all about me while you enjoy that last drink. I'm sure we'll meet again, my sweet, and then perhaps you'll be...better equipped for what I have in mind.

[ DEVIOUS FEATURES ]
Devious Devices! -- Multiple new and devious devices to torment the Dragonborn (and entertain yourself with at the same time!), including, but not limited to: chastity belts, collars, cuffs, special plugs, gags, and even the legendary armbinder! And don't worry about wiggling out of them; all devices lock in place, and only the right key can open the locks! And as an added bonus, all devices are craftable, once you learn how!

Devious Effects! -- Unique and devious effects to tantalize, titillate, and torment the Dragonborn and her companions! Whether it's inflatable, vibrating, or simply impossible to remove, you'll find something different with each item! All plugs increase stimulation, and do so at different rates based on what you do; sitting down or riding a horse is much more intense than just walking around! The inflatable plugs can be squeezed manually for more stimulation, or by accident as you travel around Skyrim! Want something more intense? Try the vibrating soulgem plugs! Some are activated by magic, others will have a mind of their own and activate randomly or after building up for a good strong burst of vibrations. But watch out, there are some plugs out there that are much more devious: the victim will be driven to the edge by these relentless plugs, but never allowed sweet release...

Devious Quests! -- Track down the forbidden bookshelf and delve into the devious secrets it contains to get you started...but be warned, the librarian will not be please if you're caught... And don't forget to stay tuned for more Devious Quests in the future!

Full NPC Support! -- All devious devices are capable of being worn by NPCs, and most devious effects will function on them as well! Show your companion who's in charge, or teach that annoying bitch in the shop a lesson!

Intuitive Interfaces! -- No need to use spells, shouts, or other quirky methods to enjoy these devices! Just click them in your inventory and choose what you want to do with them via the easy to use interaction menu!

Sexlab Support! -- While in a chastity belt, the Dragonborn's (or any NPC's) most intimate of intimates will be off limits! The actors will be unable to use any sex scenes involving the "Vaginal", "Anal", "Masturbation", or "Fisting" tags. In most cases, the scene will be replaced by a chastity-friendly scene, including Oral, Blowjobs, Handjobs, Boobjobs, and whatever else may be available. While wearing gags, the Oral animations will be off limits as well, unless it happens to be a ring gag.
 
Sexlab Aroused Support! -- Being locked away in cold steel may not seem so bad at first, but the longer the Dragonborn is locked away, the more she'll crave that sweet release! Animations, on-screen messages, and even sounds will change depending upon arousal level; same with NPCs!

And Much More! -- This mod continues to grow and evolve, so there will no doubt be other features not mentioned above!

[ COMPATIBILITY AND CONFLICTS ]
General remark: The point of this mod is locking the player in restraints hard to remove. This feature might cause issues with other mods not expecting the character to wear unremovable items. Known issues will be listed in this section. Feel free to report incompatibilities in the support thread.
 
- Frostfall: While wearing restraints the player might be unable to keep herself warm. 
- Player Succubus Quest: Transformation will wipe restraints from your character, so this function is generally incompatible with DD. Disable Transformation if you want to use this mod with and DD mod.
- Trapped in Rubber: is using custom restraints not compatible with DD in general. Solution: Make sure you're not wearing any DD items before you start the quest and suspend any mod that might equip DD items on you while playing TiR.
- SPERG: Works fine, but set Hand to Hand combat to "Manual" in its MCM to avoid annoying clicking sounds when wearing wrist restraints.
- Play Random Idle - can break custom idles used by our restraints.

[ KNOWN ISSUES ]
- The 'equipped' indicator for the belt may not update immediately following player interaction. This can be solved easily by closing and reopening the inventory or selecting another item (It is simply a display quirk).
- Attempting to interact with a specific device while having multiple instances of it in your inventory is ill-advised, due to a limitation with Skyrim. Doing so will unpredictably cause Skyrim to not send the Papyrus events that the devices require to function (OnUnequipped / OnEquipped), leading to a device visually being equipped, despite being unequipped in your inventory. If you encounter this issue, remove all but one copy of the problem-device from your inventory, then re-equip said device.

[ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ]
Q) How do I start the Forbidden Tome questline?
A) If you already had the "Devious Devices" book from a previous version of the mod, drop it and pick it back up. Otherwise, just go take it from the forbidden bookshelf in the Arcaneum in Winterhold (it's located to the right of Urag's desk if you're facing it coming in, in the set of bookshelves beneath the wolf's head, last shelf on the right in that section). The quest will begin immediately if Urag catches you opening the shelf, otherwise you will need to initiate a conversation with him and ask about the tome.

Q) How do I craft the devices, or keys?
A) You learn to craft the devices (And keys) by reading the "Devious Devices" book you get from the bookshelf. If you want to make sure you know how to get out of the devices before Urag takes the book, make sure you read it before he gets to you to initiate the Forbidden Tome quest.

Q) I can't find Zed! Where is he, and why are there only one or two of the three quest markers on my map?
A) Have you checked Solstheim? Do you have the Falskaar mod installed? If so, check there as well; he can be at any Dwemer ruins, as the location is picked via the Radiant system. If you're particularly picky, you can save just before Urag initiates the quest, and reload that save until all of the quest locations are in Skyrim proper.

Q) I unequipped an item, but it's still visually on my character!
A) See the "Known Issues" section.
